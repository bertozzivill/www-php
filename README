Hello! Welcome to your account.

This is your home directory. It's full path is /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/ - don't worry if you don't know what
this means. You really don't need to know it for general use. However it is nice to know for certain scripts.

By default, your home directory has the following directories:

www - This is where all your website files go. By default, only the files you upload to your www directory are
viewable on the internet. Files "above" the www directory are not viewable.

etc - This directory contains a php.ini file that you can customize with the php options you need. It is important to note
that this php.ini file takes effect ONLY when you are using php as a cgi (you can change this in your control panel). The
default php configuration  (mod_php) does NOT use your custom php.ini. When using the default configuration you can change
php options using .htaccess files.

If you need help, enter a support ticket. We're here for you!



Please Note:

Until your account is manually verified by a system administrator, some functions will not work. In particular, sending of email 
via php's mail() function is disabled. This is done to protect your server against abuse. As soon as your account has been manually verified, all
functions will be enabled. php's safe_mode will also be removed once your account is verified.
